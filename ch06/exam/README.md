# CS110 Midterm Exam

## SHORT DESCRIPTION *(1 or 2 sentences describing your program)*
Randomly Draws clouds on the screen of slightly varying sizes and varying amounts of bumps
## KNOWN BUGS AND INCOMPLETE PARTS *(list any known bugs or non-working parts)*
the tail of the cloud may look a little strange on the smaller ones
## REFERENCES *(any resources you use outside of class materials)*
Turtle Library: https://docs.python.org/3/library/turtle.html
Random Library: https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html
## MISCELLANEOUS COMMENTS *(anything else you would like the grader to know)*
- the magic number is the angle that the turtle turns in  between each bump of the cloud, for some reason, it just works really well with any number of bumps
- the clouds are generated in random places at random sizes, so every single iteration is unique!!!
